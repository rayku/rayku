How to add banner templates?
==========================
Banners must be GIF images using the size 650x350 and must use numbers as filename
If you want to have 200 banner templates, they must have the name 1.gif to 200.gif
It is very important to use lowercase characters for the extersion (meaning .GIF is not the same as .gif)

You cannot skip numbers or things will break, meaning you cannot add 1.gif, skip 2.gif and continue with 3.gif
