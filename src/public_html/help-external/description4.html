- <strong>the better you tutor, the more you get paid! (and the more "experience" you get)</strong><br />
- you start at level 1. Automatically upgrade to level 2 with a certain amount of "experience"<br />
- level 2 tutors can set their own rates, get paid for being 'available', and rank higher<br />
- to gain "experience", be available often, tutor well, and post on the forums<br /><br />
