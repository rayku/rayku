This is a standalone PHP library that can be used in any PHP project.
It serves as a service layer at top of all Rayku Communication Channels.

Currently we are supporting following CC's:
- web
- gtalk
- facebook
- native Rayku Windows/Mac client



TODOS:
* make sure we are compliant with PSR-0 and start using autoloader
* write some unit tests :P
